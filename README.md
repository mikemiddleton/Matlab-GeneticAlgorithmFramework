# MatlabeGeneticAlgorithmFramework
A quick genetic algorithm framework writtin with Matlab. 

The creation of this framework was prompted by the assignment of a project in my numerical analysis course. The assignment was to apply the different iterative and stochastic principles into a working code framework focused towards an existing research area. Having never looked into genetic algorithms before, I decided to take a stab at making a genetic algorithm framework in Matlab (the primary tool used for this course).
